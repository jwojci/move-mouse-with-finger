app uses google's mediapipe hands to detect hands and pyautogui library to perform mouse actions <br /> <br />

Right hand index finger is used for moving the mouse <br />
Pinch with left hand to perform left mouse button click <br />
(This is still a WIP as the mouse tends to be jittery and the pinch is not always recognized well) <br /> <br />
