app uses google's mediapipe hands to detect hands and pyautogui library to perform mouse actions

Right hand index finger is used for moving the mouse
Pinch with left hand to perform left mouse button click
(This is still a WIP as the mouse tends to be jittery and the pinch is not always recognized well)
